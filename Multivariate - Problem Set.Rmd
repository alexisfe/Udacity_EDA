Import necessary libraries and data sets

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

data(diamonds)
```

Create a histogram of diamond prices. Facet the histogram by diamond color and use cut to color the histogram bars.
```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=log(price), color=cut)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~color)
```

Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.table and color the points by the cut of the diamond.
```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=table, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point()
```
Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs. volume (x * y * z) and color the points by the clarity of diamonds. 
Use scale on the y-axis to take the log10 of price. You should also omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=x*y*z, y=price, color=clarity)) + scale_y_log10()
```
